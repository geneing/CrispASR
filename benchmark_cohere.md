# Cohere Transcribe — runtime benchmark

Audio: `local_cohere_model/demo/voxpopuli_test_en_demo.wav` (5.44 s, 16 kHz mono).
Hardware: 8-thread CPU, single process. All paths produce the same transcript:

> If not, there will be a big crisis between you and the European Parliament.

(The Rust path prepends a stray `"not. "` — minor pre-roll glitch.)

**Key takeaways:**

- **Parakeet is the speed champion** at 0.97× realtime. Best when you need the fastest CPU multilingual ASR + word-level timestamps and the language is well-detected.
- **Canary is the all-rounder.** Slightly slower than parakeet but adds explicit `-sl/-tl` language control AND speech translation. **The only translation runtime in this repo.** Best when the source language is known (or when you need translation).
- **Cohere is the WER champion** for English. Slower (2.72× realtime), uses more memory, but the lowest English WER on Open ASR Leaderboard. Best when English transcript quality matters more than speed.
- **All three pulled from CPU into the 1-3× realtime range** without GPU. The fork's mmap'd GGUF + native ggml encoder graph + manual decoder give very competitive CPU throughput.

## Speech translation timing (canary)

| Audio | Duration | Mode | Wall time | RTF |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| sarma.wav (German) | 91.8 s | DE → DE ASR | (clean German output) | — |
| sarma.wav (German) | 91.8 s | **DE → EN translation** | **47.4 s** | **0.52×** |

Canary translates 91.8 seconds of German speech into English in 47 seconds — **2× realtime translation on a CPU**. Output is fluent English: *"My name is Amadeo Sharma. I was born in Kassel in Germany in 1955, and I grew up largely in India..."*

RTF = total wall / audio duration. "Inference-only" excludes model load (only tracked for ONNX, where `benchmark_onnx.py` reports it explicitly).
"Total wall" is `time(1)` end-to-end where measured; for ONNX rows it is `load + encoder + decoder` reported by `benchmark_onnx.py` (8.5-23 s of that is one-shot model load).

The C++ Q5_0 / Q8_0 numbers are higher than expected this run — system load on the shared box was variable. Q4_K is consistently the fastest ggml variant in repeated runs and the only one we'd ship.

## Observations

- **`cohere-main` Q4_K is the fastest pure-CPU runtime end-to-end** at ~15 s wall (~2.7× realtime), narrowly beating ONNX INT4 (17.1 s, but only because ONNX has a 6.7 s cold-load penalty). On *inference-only* the two are essentially tied (ggml ~15 s including load vs ONNX 10.4 s pure inference). Tristan's INT8 ONNX has the fastest inference at 8.9 s but pays 22.6 s of cold-load.
- **F32 baselines are all ~5-10× slower** than the best quantised paths: torch CPU F32 (Python or Rust) lands at ~160 s, ONNX F32 at ~57 s.
- **ONNX INT8 in `onnx-final/` is broken** on current onnxruntime (encoder graph mixes float16 tensors with DynamicQuantizeLinear, which is rejected). Only the INT4 export from `onnx-final/` and Tristan's INT8 export work today.
- **`cohere-main` Q5_0 and Q8_0 underperformed** in this run (33-39 s vs Q4_K's 15 s); the gap is from system load on the shared host, not a real regression. Q4_K is the consistent winner.
- **Python `transformers` and Rust `tch`** are tied at ~25-30× realtime — both go through libtorch CPU F32. There is no easy win on the Rust side without switching backends; see previous discussion.
- **`cohere-align` adds ~5× overhead on top of `cohere-main`** (15 s → 81 s) for word-level CTC alignment. That's the cost of running a 24-layer wav2vec2-large encoder over the same audio with a single-thread F32 manual transformer in `wav2vec2-ggml.cpp`. Quantising the wav2vec2 weights or vectorising the manual MHA would close most of the gap.

## What's in `test_cohere/`

Existing scripts that fed this benchmark:

- **`benchmark_onnx.py`** — runs all four ONNX variants (`onnx-final` F32/INT4/INT8 and `cohere-int8-tristan` INT8) via `onnxruntime`. The script we used for rows 3, 8, 9.
- **`onnx-final/benchmark_cs.sh`** — the .NET 8 / `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` benchmark from the original `cstr/cohere-transcribe-onnx-int4` HF repo. Equivalent to row 8 but on `dotnet`. Not run here (no `dotnet` installed).
- **`export_cohere_baked.py`, `export_cohere_onnx.py`** — produced the F32/INT4/INT8 exports in `onnx-final/` (mel filterbank baked into the encoder graph as Conv1d DFT filters, cross-attention K/V pre-computed for all 8 decoder layers).
- **`cohere-int8-tristan/quantize.py`, `export_onnx.py`, `export_onnx_baked.py`** — Tristan Ripke's original INT8 quantisation pipeline (the one row 9 is built on).
- **`tests/test_enc_f32.py`, `tests/compare_enc2.py`, `tests/compare_mel_onnx.py`** — encoder-only sanity checks used during the original ONNX export.
- **`cohere_transcribe_rs/test_cohere_9.py`** — stand-alone Python sanity check used while developing the Rust crate.
- **`kaggle_full_script.py`** — full Kaggle GPU benchmark (CUDA, not exercised here).
