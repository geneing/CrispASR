# Streaming & live transcription

CrispASR supports three streaming modes — pipe input, microphone
capture, and continuous live mode — and per-token confidence output.
All work with every supported backend.

## Pipe mode (`--stream`)

```bash
# Pipe audio from ffmpeg, sox, or any tool that outputs raw PCM:
ffmpeg -i audio.wav -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 - | \
    crispasr --stream -m model.gguf
```

Sliding-window chunking, default 10 s window with 3 s step and 200 ms
overlap. Tune via `--stream-step`, `--stream-length`, `--stream-keep`.

Quality-control flags supported in streaming mode:

- `--vad`, `--vad-model`, `--vad-threshold`, `--vad-min-speech-duration-ms`, `--vad-min-silence-duration-ms`, `--vad-speech-pad-ms`
- `--punc-model` and `--no-punctuation`

Notes:

- With VAD enabled, each streaming window is segmented before ASR. Silent windows are skipped instead of being decoded.
- `--punc-model` applies after streamed chunk transcription, matching file-mode post-processing.
- `--alt` / `--alt-n` are file-mode features. They currently do not print token alternatives from `--stream`, `--mic`, or `--live`.
- File-oriented output flags such as `-osrt`, `-ovtt`, `-oj`, and `-of` do not apply to `--stream` / `--mic` / `--live`; streaming writes transcripts to stdout.

## Microphone (`--mic`)

```bash
# Live microphone transcription (auto-detects arecord/sox/ffmpeg):
crispasr --mic -m model.gguf
```

CrispASR auto-detects whichever audio capture tool is on `$PATH`.

## Continuous live mode (`--live`)

```bash
# Continuous live mode (prints each chunk as a new line, never stops):
crispasr --live -m model.gguf

# With progress monitor symbols (▶ processing, ✓ got text, · silence):
crispasr --live --monitor -m model.gguf
```

`--live` runs indefinitely, emitting one transcript line per processed
chunk. `--monitor` adds visual feedback so you can tell processing
state at a glance.

## Per-token confidence

```bash
crispasr -m model.gguf -f audio.wav --alt
```

`--alt` prints alternative candidate tokens with probabilities — useful
for filtering low-confidence file transcriptions or for downstream
rescoring. Streaming modes do not currently emit this alternatives
block.

## Tuning the sliding window

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--stream-step N` | `3000` ms | Step between consecutive windows. Smaller = more frequent partial transcripts. |
| `--stream-length N` | `10000` ms | Total context window length. Larger = better accuracy on long-form content but higher per-step cost. |
| `--stream-keep N` | `200` ms | Overlap between adjacent windows. Smooths boundary artifacts. |

For native streaming-architecture backends (`voxtral4b`,
`moonshine-streaming`, `kyutai-stt`), the encoder runs incrementally —
the sliding window flags above still apply but the per-chunk cost is
lower than for batch backends.
